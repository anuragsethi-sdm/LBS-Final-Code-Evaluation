
1.) Project Overview:

 This project focuses on predicting housing prices using machine learning. We utilize the RandomForest algorithm to analyze housing data and make predictions based on features such as location, size, area, and more. The data is stored in a .csv file, which is used to train our model and make predictions.

2.) Liabraries and Ebvironment Setup:
    
    This project mainly includes the following files:

    a. HousePrice_SmartData.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook containing the complete machine learning workflow — importing libraries, preprocessing data, training the model, and evaluating it.

    b. app.py: The main Python file containing Streamlit code that serves as the web interface. It allows users to input housing features and receive price predictions.

    c. HousingData.csv: The dataset containing historical housing data used for training the model.

    d. RFC_model.pkl: A pickle file generated when running app.py, containing the trained RandomForestClassifier model.

    e. scaler.pkl: A pickle file containing the StandardScaler used to scale the dataset features before prediction.

3.) Libraries and Environment Setup
    
    The main libraries used in this project are:

    Pandas – For loading the .csv file and performing data manipulation.

    NumPy – For numerical operations and array processing.

    Scikit-learn – For implementing machine learning algorithms, model training, and evaluation.

    Streamlit – For building the interactive web interface.

4.) How to Run the Project
    
    Step 1: Install the required libraries:


    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn streamlit
    
    Step 2: Run the Streamlit application:

    streamlit run app.py
    
    Step 3: Open your web browser and go to:
    http://localhost:8501 to access the user interface.

5.) Input and Output Explanation
    
    Input:
    Users will enter housing features such as area, number of rooms, location, etc., in the web interface.

    Output:
    The application will display the predicted housing price based on the input features.

6.) How to Test with New Data
    
    Run the application by executing the command:

    streamlit run app.py
    Once the UI loads, input new housing features into the provided fields.

    Click the “Predict” button.

    The predicted price will be displayed on the screen instantly.

7.) Conclusion

    This project demonstrates how machine learning (specifically the RandomForest algorithm) can be used to predict housing prices based on various input features. The integration of Streamlit provides an easy-to-use web interface for real-time predictions.
